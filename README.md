# RISCV_RV32I

This is a simplified version of the design given at from https://github.com/nobotro/fpga_riscv_cpu

For a more professional design, please see https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32

Both github repos have contain necessary information about using the GNU RISC-V compiler, compiling
a C/C++ project, and running it on the system (CPU + Memory + Minimal IO for leds) instantiated on an FPGA.
